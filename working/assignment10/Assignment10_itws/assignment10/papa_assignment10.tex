\section{Modeling Twitter data (10 points)}

In the meme paper\footnote{\url{http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00335}} by Weng et al., in Figure 2\footnote{Slide 27, Lecture Meme spreading on the Web} you find a plot, comparing the system entropy with the average user entropy. Your task is to reproduce the plot and corresponding calculations.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We provide you with the file 'onlyhashtag.dataâ€™, containing a collection
of hashtags from tweets. Use this data to reproduce the plot from the paper.
Once you have the values for average user entropy and system entropy calculated
per day create a scatter plot to display the values.
\item Interpret the scatter plot and compare it with the authors interpretation from the
graph 
%produced on the previous step and 
showed in the paper. Will the interpretations be compatible to each other or will they contradict each other? Do not write more than 5 sentences.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hints}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use formulas from the lecture to calculate the entropy for one user and the system entropy.
\item Do not forget to give proper names of plot axes.
\end{enumerate}

We can see that as the author mentioned, user's attention remains constant trough the days, contrary to the system's entropy which grows almost exponentially. We interpret this as "No matter how many new memes are there out there, users will only be able to manage on average the same amount of memes".

\section{Measuring inequality (10 points)}

We provide you with a sample implementation of the Chinese Restaurant Process\footnote{File ``chinese\_restaurant.py"; Additional information can be found here: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant_process}}.

Assume there is a restaurant with an infinite number of tables. 
When a new customer enters a restaurant he chooses an occupied table or the next empty table with some probabilities.


According to the process first customer always sits at the first table. 
Probability of the next customer to sit down at an occupied table $i$ equals 
 ratio of guests sitting at the table ($c_i/n$), where $n$ is the number of guests in the restaurant and $c_i$ is the number of guests sitting at table $i$.\\
 Probability of customer to choose an empty table equals :  $1- \sum_{i=1}^{S}{p_i}$, where $S$ is the number of occupied tables and ${p_i}$ = $c_i/n$.
 
Provided script simulates the process and returns number of people sitting at each table. We will study restaurants for 1000 customers.
Now you should modify the code and evaluate how unequal were the customers' choices of tables.   

%In this exercise,
%you should use it to simulate the growth of a network via the following process:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item A customer X sitting at a table Y, represents an edge from node X to node Y .
%\item With X tables occupied, a new customer taking a new table, will take place at table X + 1.
%\end{itemize}

% In the lecture `Herding Behavior' we discussed paper\footnote{`Experimental Study of Inequality and Unpredictability in an Artificial Cultural Market.', can be accessed from  \url{https://www.princeton.edu/~mjs3/salganik_dodds_watts06_full.pdf} } by Salganik et al. The authors used the Gini-coefficient to measure the inequality and in the lecture you have see how this coefficient stabilizes over time.

%Simulate a network with the Chinese Restaurant process and 
Calculate the Gini-
coefficient measuring the inequality between the tables,
until the coefficient stabilizes. Do five different runs and plot your results in a similar way that plots in the lecture slides are done, cf. Slide 32 and Slide 33.

\section{Herding (10 points)}
Let us consider the altitude of Koblenz to be 74 m above sea level. You are asked to figure out the height of the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress and the Fernmeldeturm Koblenz without googling.\\
The exercise is split in two parts:\\ \\
\underline{Part 1 : The Secret}\\
In \textit{complete secrecy}, each member of the team will write down their estimated height of the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress without any form of discussion. Please keep in mind that you need to have reasons for your assumption. Once you are done, then openly discuss in the group and present you values in a tabulated format with the reasons each one assumed to arrive at that value. 

\underline{Part II : The Discussion}\\
Discuss amongst yourself with valid reasoning  what could be the height of the Fernmeldeturm Koblenz. Only after discussing, each member of the group is asked to arrive at a value and present this value in a tabulated format as was done in Part I. \\ \\
Calculate the Mean, Standard Deviation and Variance of your noted results for both the cases and explain briefly what you infer from it. 

\textbf{Note:} This exercise is for you to understand the concepts of herding and not to get the perfect height by googling information. There is in fact no point associated with the height but with the complete reasoning that you provide for your answers. \\ \\

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | p{7cm} | }
\hline
Monument & Height (in meters) & Reasoning \\
\hline
 Fortress & 240 & The lenght of the seilbahn don't seem that long so the mountain can't be that tall \\ 
 \hline
 Fortress & 300 & Taking into consideration that Koblenz is at a 74 m altitude, as the fortress stands on small hill it can't be taller than estimated. \\  
 \hline
 Fortress & 375 & Compared to Deutsches Eck the hill seems tall enough for me to reach about this height.  \\
\hline
 Tower & 400 &  I just assume the tower is in a much higher hill than the fortress. Therefore i think is this much higher  \\
 \hline
 Tower & 450 & Based on my initial guess about the fortress. I believe that the tower is a copule of hundred meters taller than this hill altitude.  \\
 \hline
 Tower & 450 & I think this tower is located on a hill that is considerably much taller than the fortress.  \\
