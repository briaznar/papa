Knowing that Koblenz is at a 74 m altitude and placed in a depression, I assume that the fortress is around 300 m high as it stands on small hill.

Based on my initial assumption I believe that the tower is at around 450m altitude, the human factor makes me believe that this hill is bigger than the one the fortress stands on.
